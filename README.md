This project is a starter for creating serverless HTTP APIs on AWS Lambda. Here are some of it's key features:

- built with the excellent [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework
- uses the [Mangum](https://mangum.io/) ASGI adapter for AWS Lambda
- leverages the [Docker runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html), because who really wants to mess around with Lambda layers and .zip-files?
- project management with [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/1.9/)
- opinionated, strict and automatic enforcement of code style - less room to argue, more time to be productive

## 🏗️ Setup

This project is managed by [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/1.9/) - follow the instructions [here](https://hatch.pypa.io/1.9/install/) for setting up hatch on your machine. This project requires you to have Python >=3.8 available.

```bash
hatch run dev:test
```

### Environments

This project provides two [environments](https://hatch.pypa.io/1.9/environment/):

- `default`: This one has only the runtime dependencies of the lambda function.
- `dev`: This one is used for local development, adding dev-dependencies like `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, etc.

### 📜 Scripts

There are a number of scripts available to perform common develpment tasks. They are defined for the `dev` environment and can be invoked by running: `hatch run dev:<name of script>`, e.g. `hatch run dev:lint`.
